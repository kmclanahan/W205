Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

I did not see a correlation with high scores for prcedural quality or variability with the survey responses. The highest rated hospitals from the surveys are as follows:

MIDWEST SURGICAL HOSPITAL LLC   80.0    1
PHYSICIAN'S CARE SURGICAL HOSPITAL      80.0    1
PHYSICIANS CENTRE,THE   80.0    1
PHYSICIANS' SPECIALTY HOSPITAL  80.0    1
PHYSICIANS MEDICAL CENTER       80.0    1
MANHATTAN SURGICAL HOSPITAL LLC 80.0    1
BLACK HILLS SURGICAL HOSPITAL LLP       80.0    1
OUACHITA COMMUNITY HOSPITAL     80.0    1
ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL OF WISCONSIN       80.0    1
SURGICAL HOSPITAL AT SOUTHWOODS 80.0    1
NORTH CENTRAL SURGICAL CENTER LLP       80.0    1
FAYETTE MEDICAL CENTER  80.0    1
LAFAYETTE SURGICAL SPECIALTY HOSPITAL   80.0    1
WESTLAKE REGIONAL HOSPITAL      80.0    1
ADVANCED SURGICAL HOSPITAL      80.0    1
HEART HOSPITAL OF LAFAYETTE     80.0    1
FAIRWAY MEDICAL CENTER  80.0    1
SACRED HEART HOSPITAL ON THE GULF       80.0    1
DAKOTA PLAINS SURGICAL CENTER LLP       80.0    1
QUAIL CREEK SURGICAL HOSPITAL   80.0    1

I suspect this is due to the relatively small amount of survey data available for each hospital. Only 9 hospitals have more than 3 survey responses in the data set, and these hospitals were not ranked very highly. It's possible that these are busier than the hospitals that have only a single survey, and thus the patient's perceived rating of their care was higher than the methodology for determining their procedural proficiency in the effective care data.
