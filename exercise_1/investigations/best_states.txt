What states are models of high-quality care?

Using a similar methodology as with individual hospitals, looking at the cumulative scores in each state could identify which are exemplary models of good care. However, since some states will have more data points than others, I decided to look at the states with the top ten average scores over all treatments. The model states are as follows:
